A rock paper scissors robot usually involves using some combination of hardware and software to create a system that can play the game of rock paper scissors against a human opponent. This might involve designing a robotic arm or hand that can make the three different hand gestures, as well as developing computer vision or machine learning algorithms that can recognize which gesture the human player has made.
The robot typically consists of a mechanical arm with a gripper that can simulate the hand gestures of rock, paper, or scissors. The robot also has sensors such as cameras, that can detect the position and movement of the human player's hand (Figure 1).
To play the game, the human player makes their hand gesture of choice while the robot analyses the gesture in real-time using its sensors. Once the robot recognizes the human player's gesture, it uses its algorithms to determine the optimal response (i.e., the gesture that beats the human player's gesture) and makes its own gesture.
