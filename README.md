A rock paper scissors robot usually involves using some combiniation of hardware and software to create a system that can play the game of rock paper scissors against a human opponent. This might involve designing a robotic arm or hand that can make the three different hand gestures, as well as developing computer vision or machine learning algorithms that can recognize which gesture the human player has made.
